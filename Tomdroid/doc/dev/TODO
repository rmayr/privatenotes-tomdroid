TODO tasks
==========
Problems with 0.4.1:
- SDK 1.5 support was removed, how many devices are still on it? If more than 20%, I should try to get it to work on it again.
file:///home/olivier/soft/android-sdk-linux_86/docs/guide/practices/screens_support.html#strategies

Unclassified:
- check to merge https://code.launchpad.net/~tomdroid-dev/tomdroid/ContextMenu
- find a sample use of the ContentProvider regarding Edouard's branch: searchbar-on-0.3/ and tell him
- basic note editing
- improve responsiveness when loading notes from sdcard
-- benchmark what's going on
-- confirm: the listview observer over list adapter is eating lots of resources?
- Fix the TODO and FIXME statements all over in the code
- Long-press options on links. How-to: http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/browse_thread/thread/acdd8777763b6028
- The android logo should have a white border around it, fix that then regen the logo (http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2009/05/android-icon-guidelines.html)
- internationalize strings with techniques like: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/available-resources.html#stringresources
- Replace NoteCollection's structure to a hashmap or hashtable
- Avoid code duplication between NoteBuilder and AsyncNoteLoaderAndParser
- Follow UI design guidelines (http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/activity_task_design.html)
- Write a README and INSTALL manual to generate package from source, etc. To be put in project's root
- use @author tag in class comments to identify a piece of code maintainer (java code convention, used by apache)

Port threading to Android's mechanism (maybe wait to check for 1.5's new API):
- Check Handler / Looper / AsyncQueryHandler classes

SD card sync:
- Syncing from SD card only adds notes from the SD card and overwrite on identical guid. At some point, we'll have to consider deletions.

File format: (to be in sync with Tomdroid's)
- Why is title repeated in note text?
- Add a metadata version to the "Sync with local folder" manifest
- Build a validator for the "Sync with local folder" Manifest
- check everrnote dtd for inspiration: http://www.evernote.com/about/developer/
- integrate upstream work in relax-ng and validate with latest jing-trang (http://code.google.com/p/jing-trang/)

Market release:
- implement application upgrade mechanism as suggested in http://developer.android.com/guide/publishing/publishing.html#marketupgrade
- read / edit notes

Future:
- Check Conboy for UI inspiration (http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=28355)
  Now if only I could find a RichEditView for Android..
